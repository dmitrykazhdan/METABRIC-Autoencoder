# Extracting High-Quality Features From Biomedical Datasets Using Multimodal Autoencoders

This project explores the use of a multimodal autoencoder (implemented in Keras) for learning a shared data representation from the METABRIC breast cancer dataset in order to improve classification accuracy of cancer subtype classifiers by learninig high quality features.
